# IBM_Z_Datathon
This repository contains the files that have been done by Team DataDoc during IBM Z Datathon on the Problem Statement of Predicting Dyslexia - a learing disorder in which children are unable to read and write properly and they face difficulties in speaking. So we have decided to create and train an ML model to identify dyslexia among children.
